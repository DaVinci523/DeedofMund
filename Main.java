Mundulin erupted in cavities from the hidden land below, the land of Larce Ekkus. Great beasts, known as the Wyverns, emerged from the trenches with only one thing in their mind; terminate the human race. The Vulnin Cohort leaped to intervene with the Wyverns. Their battle raged through Mundulin, but it was to no avail. Those valiant to stand were overwhelmed by the sheer power of the monsters. Mundulin fell to ruin within days and Larce Ekkus had taken hold of the nation. The Wyverns still roam below, still searching for those to stand against them. They will get their wish soon enough. As the last of the Vulnin Cohort, you somehow must fell the Wyverns and restore the lands of Mundulin to their rightful glory. You begin in the quaint village of Titilus...");
